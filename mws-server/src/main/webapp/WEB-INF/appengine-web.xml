	<!-- Optional. App Engine includes an implementation of sessions, using 
		the servlet session interface. The implementation stores session data in 
		Datastore for persistence, and also uses memcache for speed. As with most 
		other servlet containers, the session attributes that are set with `session.setAttribute()` 
		during the request are persisted at the end of the request. This feature 
		is off by default. To turn it on, add the following to appengine-web.xml -->
